# Unity-Tanks
Unity Tanks tutorial, also on my devpost account, quick and easy experimenting with C# programming language, worked with importing sprites, and followed up with a little bit of programming game logic. Most of the effects were downloaded, I just needed to put it together. Did this in about 8 hours at a mini Hackathon. Would like to someday return to playing with scripts, assets, and programming in
C#. However, not sure when this next time will be.
